          Statement, such as www.Inspedium.Email.com, www.inspedium.cloud,
          www.inspedium.com, or any website or mobile application owned,

          In some cases we may use cookies and other tracking technologies
          described in this Cookie Statement to collect Personal Inormation, or

        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          online service providers in order, for example, to make their websites
          or services work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide
          reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case,
          Inspedium.Email) are called “first-party cookies”. Cookies set by
          parties other than the website owner are called “third-party cookies”.
          Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website or service, you use (such as
          advertising, interactive content and analytics). The third parties
          that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer when it
          visits the website or service in question and when it visits certain
          other websites or services.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h2>
        <p>
          We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Inspedium
          Sites and Service to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or
          “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies enable us and the third
          parties we work with to track and target the interests of Visitors to
          our Inspedium Sites, and we refer to these as “performance” or
          “functionality” cookies. For example, we use cookies to tailor content
          and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise
          personalize your experience while interacting with our Inspedium Sites
          and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Service we provide.
          We also enable our Members to deploy cookies and similar tracking
          technologies in connection with their use of our Service in order to
          allow our Members to track their Contacts or end users. Finally, third
          parties serve cookies through our Inspedium Sites and Service for
          advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more
          detail below.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies served through Inspedium Sites</h2>
        <p>
          The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our
          Inspedium Sites and the purposes they perform are described in further
          detail below:
        </p>
        <h2>Essential Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with the services
          and features available through our Inspedium Sites. Because these
          cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Inspedium Sites, you
          cannot refuse them without impacting how the Inspedium Sites function.
          You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as
          described under the heading "How can I control cookies?" in this
          Cookie Statement.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of
          the Inspedium Sites. They help us to know which pages are the most and
          least popular and to see how visitors move around the Inspedium Sites.
          Although important to us, these cookies are non-essential to the use
          of the Inspedium Sites. However, without these cookies, certain
          functionality may become unavailable.
        </p>
        <h2>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          These cookies collect information that is used either to help us
          understand how the Inspedium Sites are being used or how effective our
          marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Inspedium Sites
          and application for you in order to enhance your experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Advertising (Targeting) Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to
          you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing
          the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are
          properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that
          are based on your interests. For further information, see the section
          of the Cookie Statement entitled "Targeted online advertising".
        </p>
        <h2>Other tracking technologies</h2>
        <p>
          We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies
          from time to time, like web beacons, SDKs, pixels (or “clear gifs”)
          and other tracking technologies. Pixels are tiny graphics files that
          contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone
          has visited our Inspedium Sites or, in the case of web beacons, opened
          an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to
          monitor the traffic patterns of Visitors from one page within our
          Inspedium Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
          understand whether you have come to our Inspedium Sites from an online
          advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted
          advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site
          performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While
          you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these
          tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are
          reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those
          instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these
          technologies.
        </p>

        <h2>Targeted online advertising</h2>
        <p>
          We have engaged one or more third-party service providers to track and
          analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information
          from interactions with our Inspedium Sites. We also partner with one
          or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to display
          advertising on our Inspedium Sites and/or to manage and serve
          advertising on other sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar
          tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about
          your online activities, either on our Inspedium Sites and/or other
          sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted
          advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing
          activities and inferred interests (“Interest Based Advertising”). For
          more information about this practice, click here:
          www.aboutads.info/choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons
          to collect information about your visits to our Inspedium Sites and/or
          other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements
          and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data
          on how many times you click on one of our ads).

        <div className={classes.definition}>
          <h2>Facebook: </h2>
          <p>
            We also use Meta's pixel to identify users who have landed on
            certain pages for the purposes of target group-orientated
            remarketing and advertising. The Meta pixel stores a cookie, which
            means that information about your visit to our Inspedium Site will
            be shared with Facebook. These cookies and the information collected
            are used to create target groups to help Facebook deliver
            advertising on our behalf to users who have previously visited our
            Inspedium Site when they are on Facebook or a digital platform
            powered by Facebook Advertising, and to track advertising success.
            You can modify your Facebook Ad settings to restrict these
            advertisements. Navigate to Settings/Adverts in your Facebook
            account to adjust your preferences. Learn more about the different
            types of Facebook cookies here: www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/

        <p>Member use of the Inspedium.Email platform</p>
        <p>
          We use third paty services in order to better understand our Members'
          needs and to optimize our Service and the end user experience. Such
          services may use first-party cookies to record a Members' activities
          on the Inspedium.Email platform.

        <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.</p>

        <div className={classes.definition}>
          <h2>Browser Controls: </h2>
          <p>
            You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse
            cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
            Inspedium Sites though your access to some functionality and areas
            of our Inspedium Sites may be restricted. As the means by which you
            can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
            browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for

            Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising: Most advertising networks
            offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising. If you
            would like to find out more information, please visit

          <h2>Mobile Advertising: </h2>
          <p>
            You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used
            for certain types of Interest Based Advertising, including those
            performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android
            mobile device and following the most recent published instructions.
            If you opt out, we will remove all data about you and no further
            data collection or tracking will occur. The random ID we (or our
            third-party partners) had previously assigned to you will also be
            removed. This means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in,
            we will not be able to continue and track you using the same ID as
            before, and you will for all practical purposes be a new end user to
            our system.

        <div className={classes.definition}>
          <h2>Do Not Track: </h2>
          <p>
            Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari
            - include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals.
            Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our
            Inspedium Sites, Connected Sites, Landing Pages, and Websites do not
            currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. Inspedium.Email takes
            privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to
            continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and
            the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please
            visit https://allaboutdnt.com/.
