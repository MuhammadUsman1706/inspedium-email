        <p>
          At Inspedium LLC, the security of your personal information is our top
          priority. That's why we have implemented this Charter of Protection
          for Personal Information ("The Charter") to ensure that all of your
          data remains confidential and secure. Please take the time to read and
          completely understand our policy on this matter. If you have any
          queries or concerns, feel free to contact Inspedium LLC at your
          earliest convenience. Moreover, it's worth noting that while the laws
          in Delaware, the USA and Pakistan only shield natural persons'
          personal information and identity, Inspedium LLC will implement those
          laws for legal entities as if they were lawfully protected too.
