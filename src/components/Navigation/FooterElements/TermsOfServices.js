          of spam or bulk messages that contain people who have not agreed to be

        <h2>ACCOUNTS</h2>
        <p>
          To use our services, you must either be at least 18 years old or the
          age of majority in your state. We only offer these services to people,

        </p>
        <p>
          If you open an account with Inspedium.Email, it is your responsibility
          to make sure the information provided is accurate and updated
          constantly. If this isn't followed through on, then it will be seen as
          a violation of our Terms & Conditions which could result in your

        </p>
        <p>
          When signing up with our Services, the user will immediately become a
          contracting party (“Account Owner”) and be granted access to any
          accounts associated with us. As part of this agreement, all Account

        </p>
        <h2>SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FEES</h2>
        <p>
          To access exclusive areas of the Service, you must sign up for a
          subscription agreement (“Subscription(s)”). Your payment will
          encompass Subscription Fees, Transaction Fees as well as Additional
          Charges—collectively known as “Fees.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Subscription Fees must be paid before the commencement of each month,
          quarter, bi-annual or yearly cycle (also referred to as a "Billing
          Date"). You are allowed to upgrade and downgrade your subscription at
          any time without penalty. If you opt for an upgrade then the
          difference in amount will be calculated with our pro rata calculator.
          We do not give refunds if you lower your plan selection or for unused
          periods of service under a Subscription Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          On each billing date, all unpaid fees will be listed on an invoice
          that is sent via email to the Account Owner. This same invoice can
          also be seen in a user's Inspedium Email Billing Panel account page.
          As you add Services to your plan, Transaction Fees and Additional Fees
          will automatically accumulate and appear on this bill. To ensure
          accuracy of these charges, please settle any discrepancies within two
          weeks of receiving said invoices!
        </p>
        <p>
          If we cannot process the Fees using your Authorized Card, two
          additional payment attempts will be made three days apart. Failure of
          all these processing endeavours may lead to suspension or revocation
          of access to your Account until settlement of all outstanding Fees
          plus applicable Billing Cycle charges has been done. During this
          period, you won't have access to any services provided by
          Inspedium.Email and if after 30 days from nonpayment fees remain
          unsettled, then Inspedium reserves the right for terminating Your
          Account immediately and deleting all related data & Content associated
          with it without prior notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Fees do not include any applicable federal, provincial, state,
          local or other government-mandated sales taxes, federal excise duty
          (FED), general/provincial sales taxes (GST), as well as any fees or
          charges that are currently in force or may be implemented in the
          future ("Taxes").
        </p>
        <p>
          You are required to pay all applicable taxes that come from or as a
          result of your Inspedium.Email product and Service
          subscription/purchase; these will be based on the charges related to
          the billing address you give us, which is in addition to what you're
          paying for those products and Services. The fees will then be billed
          directly onto your Authorized Card. If Inspedium doesn't charge any
          taxes regarding this process, it's up to you determine if they need
          paid and self-remit them accordingly (if so) with respective tax
          authorities in the jurisdiction where applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you change jurisdictions, it is essential to immediately
          update your physical address in the Billing Panel.
        </p>
        <h2>TERMS OF PAYMENT</h2>
        <p>
          To purchase any product or service from the Service, you must provide
          relevant information such as your credit card number and expiration
          date. These details are essential for us to process and verify the
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure your privacy and financial security, we do not store or
          collect your payment card details. Any information you provide is
          directly sent to our trusted third-party payment processors who adhere
          the strict standards of PCI-DSS set by renowned brands such as Visa,
          Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. These requirements
          guarantee that any sensitive data related to payments are safely
          managed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a fraudulent transaction - for example, an attempted
          purchase with stolen credit card information - Inspedium.Email
          reserves the right to terminate service immediately and may refer
          these cases to local law enforcement agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          By authorizing Inspedium.Email payment processors to charge any credit
          card supplied on Billing Date, you are responsible for continuously
          updating your information and ensuring that sufficient funds will be
          withdrawn accordingly. Furthermore, any existing credit balances will
          automatically be deducted on the designated Billing Date as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are delinquent in making your payments, we may temporarily
          suspend or permanently terminate your account after a certain length
          of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to ensure on-time payment for all incurred and recurring
          fees, we require a valid credit card on file. We will charge
          applicable Fees to the designated account (the "Authorized Card")
          authorized by you, and continue charging it until services are
          terminated provided that any unpaid Fees have been settled entirely.
          All charges within Inspedium.Email will appear in U.S dollars;
          therefore, please make sure payments are also made with U.S currency
          unless stated otherwise
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          By making your Content public, you grant others the right to view such
          material and accept responsibility that it complies with relevant laws
          or regulations. However, you will still remain as the sole proprietor
          of any Content that is uploaded onto our Services..
        </p>
        <p>
          By uploading Content, you are consenting: (a) to allow Inspedium.Email
          to store and publicly exhibit your Content; (b) for other internet
          users to view the publicly shared content; and (c) that if there is a
          suspicion of breach or opposition of the given Terms, Inspedium. Email
          can review all submitted Content at its discretion though it's not
          required.
        </p>

        <h2>PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION</h2>
        <p>
          At Inspedium.Email we take your privacy and the security of your
          accounts seriously. We make sure to keep all personal information safe
          while you use our services and abide by our Privacy Policy. By

        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if you fulfill any of the following criteria: (a)
          established in the European Economic Area; (b) offering goods or
          services to customers in the EEA; or (c) subject to EU General Data
          Protection Regulation requirements, your use of personal information
          belonging to residents from Europe must abide by Inspedium.Email's
          data processing addendum.
        </p>

        <h2>SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
          Your sole responsibility is to protect and safeguard the Credentials
          that enable you to access and use Inspedium.Email API, as well as any
          associated activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are held accountable for safeguarding the passwords you use to
          access our Services, as well as any activities related to them -- even
          if it's a third-party service.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's essential that you keep your passwords private, and if there is
          ever a breach in security or unauthorized access to your account, it's
          critical that you alert us immediately.
        </p>

        <h2>COMPANY RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to deny service to anyone, anytime and for any
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Inspedium.Email, we reserve the right to make a determined
          judgement of rightful account ownership and thusly transfer that
          account over to its legitimate owner. When it's difficult for us to
          distinguish who the proper holder is, we retain the authority to
          disable access temporarily until all parties involved can come up with
          an agreeable solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to settle any disputes about Account ownership, we reserve
          the right to request documentation for confirmation. For example, a
          scanned copy of your business license and government-issued photo ID
          can be used as evidence - just like the last four digits on the credit
          card you have in file.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't guarantee that we will only provide our Services to you and
          not your competitors. You understand that Inspedium.Email personnel
          might also be customers of ours, even though they are unable to use
          any confidential information of yours for their own benefit in acting
          as a competitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          After one year of using our Services, we reserve the right to modify
          or discontinue any Service (or part thereof), as well as alter prices.
          We will notify all existing customers of these changes via email
          and/or on our Website or Billing Panel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspedium.Email cannot be held responsible for any changes to the
          Service, such as pricing modifications or discontinuation of services,
          and will not accept liability towards you or any third-party in these
          cases.

            Negative repercussions resulting from any behavior of a user or

          </li>

          will take place directly between the two of you; we are not included
